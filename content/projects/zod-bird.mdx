PyTrace is a lightweight Python implementation of a traceroute tool, offering a simplified yet insightful exploration of network paths. With its ability to trace the route of packets from a source to a specified destination, PyTrace employs ICMP messages and UDP packets to unveil the journey through intermediate routers. This tool provides a hands-on understanding of network traversal, making it a valuable resource for network diagnostics and exploration.
