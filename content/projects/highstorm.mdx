KubeMongoOps is a comprehensive Kubernetes-based project facilitating efficient MongoDB management. By seamlessly deploying MongoDB and Mongo Express within a Kubernetes cluster, this solution optimizes the administration process. Leveraging secrets for secure credentials and config maps for dynamic configurations, it provides a scalable, resilient, and user-friendly environment for database operations. The included LoadBalancer ensures external access to the Mongo Express interface, simplifying the database management experience.
